            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He de≈øyreth nothynge more than our hurte, and the de≈øtruction of our realme: doo not we than violate the iudgement of nature, yf we gyue hym power and auctoritie to be our iudge? His pretended honour fyr≈øte gotten by ≈øuper≈øtition, after encrea≈øed by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,

<pb facs="tcp:9936:6"/> and to the great blemy≈ø≈øhe of theyr princely maie≈øtie. We dout nothing but a reder not parciall, wyll ≈øoone approue ≈øuche thinges, as we write in the treati≈øe folowynge, not ≈øoo moche for oure excu≈øe, as that the worlde may perceyue bothe the ≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye deceytes, craftes, &amp; ≈øubtilties of the papi≈øtes, and al≈øo, how moch we de≈øyre, that controuer≈øies in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygion maye ones be taken awaye. All that we ≈øaid there of Mantua, maye here well be ≈øpoken of Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. They do almo≈øte agree in all poyntes. Neyther it is lyke, that there woll be any more at this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cille at Vincence, than were the la≈øt yere at Mantua. Trewelye he is worthy to be deceyued, that beynge twy≈øe mocked, woll not beware the thyrde tyme. If any this la≈øte yere made forthe towarde Mantua, and
<pb facs="tcp:9936:6"/> beinge halfe on theyr waye, thanne perceyued, that they hadde taken vppon them that iourney in vaine, we do not thynke them ≈øo fooly≈øhe, that they woll hereafter ryde farre oute of towne to be mocked.

For where as in maner the hole worlde is after ≈øuch ≈øorte troublyd with warres, ≈øo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combred with the greatte prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyons that the Turke maketh, can there be any manne ≈øo agayn≈øte the ≈øetlynge of relygyon, that he wolle thynke this tyme mete for a general Councill? vndoubtedly it is mete that ≈øuch controuer≈øies, as we haue with the by≈øhoppe of Rome, be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:9936:7"/> as they are, that is much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than that they maye eyther be di≈øcu≈ø≈øed in this ≈øoo trouble≈øome a tyme, or elles be commytted vnto proctours, without oure greate ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdie, all be it the tyme were neuer ≈øo quiete.

<pb facs="tcp:9936:7"/> in noo ca≈øe make hym our arbyter, whiche not many yeres pa≈øte, oure cau≈øe not hard, gaue ≈øente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce agein≈øt vs. We woll that ≈øuche doctrine, as we, followyng the ≈øcripture, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øe, ritely to be examinid, di≈øcu≈ø≈øid, and to be brought to ≈øcripture, as to the onely touche ≈øtoone of true ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge. We wyll not ≈øuffre them to be aboly≈ø≈øhed, ere euer they be dy≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈ø≈øed, ne to be oppre≈ø≈øid, before they be knowen: moche le≈ø≈øe we wyl ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre them to be troden downe beinge ≈øo clerely trewe. No, as there is no iote in ≈øcripture, but we wolle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende it, thoughe it were with ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdie of oure lyfe, and perylle of this our Realme: ≈øoo is there noo thynge, that doth oppre≈ø≈øe this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or ob≈øcure it, but we woll be at continualle warre therwith. As we haue abrogated all olde popi≈øhe
<pb facs="tcp:9936:8"/> traditions in this our realme, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che eyther dyd helpe his tyrannye, or increa≈øe his pride: ≈øo if the grace of God for≈øake vs not, we will wel fore≈øee, that no newe naughty tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions be made with our con≈øente, to bynde vs or our realme. If men wyll not be wyllyngly blinde, they ≈øhall ea≈øily ≈øee euen by a due and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident profe in re≈øon, though grace dothe not yet by the worde of Chri≈øt enter into them, howe ≈ømall thauc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie of the by≈øhop of Rome is, by the laufull denyall of the Duke of Mantua for the place. For yf the by≈ø≈øhoppe of Rome dydde erne≈øtly intende to kepe a councyll at Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua, and hath power by the lawe of God, to calle princis to what place hym lyketh: why hathe he not al≈øo auctoritie, to cho≈øe what place hym ly≈øteth? The By≈ø≈øhop cho≈øe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,
<pb facs="tcp:9936:8"/> the Duke kepte hym out of it. If Paule the by≈øhoppe of Romes auctoritie be ≈øo great, as he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, why coulde not he compel Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericus, Duke of Mantua, that the Councylle myghte be kept there? The duke wolde not ≈øuffre it. No, he forbadde hym his towne. Howe chaunceth it, that here excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacyons flye not not abroode? Why dothe he not puny≈ø≈øhe this Duke? Why is his power, that was wonte to be more than fulle, here emptie? wonte to be more than all, here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge? Dothe he not call men in vayne to a Councylle, yf they that comme at his callynge, be excluded the place, to the whiche he callethe theym? Maye not Kynges iu≈øtely refu≈øe to come at his call, whan the Duke of Mantua may denye him the place, that he cho≈øeth? If other
<pb facs="tcp:9936:9"/> prynces order hym as the Duke of Mantua hathe doone, what place ≈øhall be lefte hym, where he maye kepe his generall Councill? Again. If Prynces haue gyuen hym this auctoritie, to calle a Councille, is hit not nece≈ø≈øarye, that they gyue hym al≈øo, all tho≈øe thynges, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute the whiche he canne not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy≈øe that his power? Shall he call men, and woll ye let hym fynde no place to calle them vnto? Truely he is not wonte to appoynte one of his owne Cyties, a place to keepe the council in. No, the good man is ≈øo faythefull and frendely towarde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ≈øeldome he de≈øyreth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be his ge≈øtis. And admitte he ≈øhulde calle vs to one of his cityes, ≈øhulde we ≈øafely walke within the walles of ≈øuch our enmies towne? were if mete for vs there to dy≈øcu≈ø≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:9936:9"/> controuer≈øyes of Relygyon, or to kepe vs out of our ennemyes trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes? meete to ≈øtudye for the defence of ≈øuche doctrine as we profe≈ø≈øe, or rather howe we myghte in ≈øuche a thronge of perylles be in ≈øauegarde of oure lyfe? Well, in this one acte the by≈øhoppe of Rome hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he hath none auctorytye vppon places in other mennes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynyons, and therfore yf he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my≈øe a Councille in any of tho≈øe, he promy≈øeth that that is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man to perfourme, and ≈øo may he deceyue vs agayne. Nowe if he calle vs to one of his owne townes, we be afrayde to be at ≈øuche an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtes table. we ≈øaye, better to ry≈øe a hungred, then to goo then≈øe with oure bellyes fulle. But they ≈øaye, the place is founde, we neede noo more ≈øeke where the Councill ≈øhall
<pb facs="tcp:9936:10"/> be kepte. As who ≈øaythe, that, that chaunced at Mantua, maye not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo chaunce at Vyncence. And as thoughe it were very lyke, that the Venecians, menne of ≈øuche wy≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ≈øhoulde not bothe fore≈øee, and feare al≈øo that, that the wy≈øe Duke of Mantua ≈øemed to feare. Certes, whanne we thynke vppon the ≈øtate, that the Venecians be in nowe, hit ≈øeemeth noo verye lykely thynge, that they woll eyther leaue Vincence, theyr Cytye, to ≈øo many nations, withoute ≈øome great gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øon of ≈øouldyers, or elles that they beinge elles where, ≈øo ≈øore charged allredy, wyll nowe nory≈ø≈øhe an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye there. And if they wolde, dothe not Paulus hym ≈øelfe graunt, that it ≈øhulde be an euyll pre≈øydent, and an euyll exaumple, to haue an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Councille? How ≈øo euer it ≈øhal

For we nothynge doubte, but you, of youre equytye, wyll ≈øtande on our ≈øyde agayn≈øte theyr ≈øubtyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye and fraudes, and iudge (except we be deceyued) that we in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øyne≈ø≈øe, neyther gaue ≈øo moche to oure affectyons, neyther withoute greate and moo≈øte iu≈øte cau≈øes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed theyr Councilles, theyr Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures, and Decrees.
